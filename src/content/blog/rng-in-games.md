## What is RNG?
RNG is short for Random Number Generation, and is used as shorthand to describe video game mechanics involving random chance. RNG is an essential feature of most games, and yet, gamers invoke RNG like it's a wrathful and chaotic god, randomly smiting some players, and blessing others with incredible fortune.

However, I am here to play devil's advocate, and briefly explain why game mechanics involving RNG have their use. 

For most games in the roguelike genre, your success in a run is heavily influenced by the items you acquire, and these items are chosen randomly from a weighted table. Because of this randomness, some runs are doomed to fail regardless of the player's skill level. This is where the frustration with RNG comes from, and I understand it. However, what is often overlooked is what would happen in its absence. 

Without RNG, players could reach a skill level where it is impossible for them to lose or experience much of a challenge, and this simply isn't fun. In a competition between a skilled and unskilled player, the winner would be decided before the match even begins. A good example of this is chess; an unskilled chess player will basically *never* beat a chess grandmaster in a competition. This makes chess an entirely skill based game. Chess being entirely skill based works in its favor, because the game is all about strategy and thinking ahead, but video games aren't necessarily the same way. Most game developers want players to experience both the lows of losing, and the highs of winning, and RNG ensures that. In competitions, it can also give the less-skilled players a fighting chance (or an even worse chance, if they're unlucky). 

# Conclusion
We may shake our fists at the sky and scream "Why, RNG, why!", but without it, some players would not experience the full spectrum of failure and success in video games.

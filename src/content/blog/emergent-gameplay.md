## What is Emergent Gameplay?
Complex gameplay that emerges from the interaction of simple game mechanics. Usually, these new gameplay mechanics emerge from players as they combine multiple simple mechanics to gain an advantage in the game. 


Minecraft has many great examples of emergent gameplay:

A simple example is how most players engage with PvE combat. In Minecraft, players have the ability to place blocks in the world, and generally speaking, mobs are not able to destroy or get past these blocks if their path is blocked. So, many players naturally adopt a combat strategy of using blocks to control mob movement and prevent them from getting close. This is emergent gameplay as it's the product of multiple simple game mechanics, and because the gameplay mechanic of using blocks in combat was not explicitly added as a mechanic by the developers.

Emergent gameplay can also be so, so incredibly complex. Some people, using a relatively simple set of logic devices (redstone), have even created 8-bit processors within the game. Yes, actual 8-bit processors, capable of running simple programs like Snake. 

In a sense, the game is mostly emergent gameplay. Minecraft provides the player with vast worlds full of interesting things, but never tells the player what they're meant to do with any of it; instead, that decision is left to the player and their imagination.

A game near and dear to me is Dwarf Fortress. Similarly to Minecraft, it provides you (the wrathful god of this little universe) the power to create whole worlds, full of complex geography, geology, history, civilizations, secrets, and so on. You can then create your own fortress, and build it from the ground down (dwarves hate the surface). There are countless interesting little mechanics, such as digging, building, climbing, falling, swimming in water, burning in lava, doors, levers, fluid pumps, and so on. From these countless mechanics, new gameplay emerges:

Players dig moats and fill them with water,

Or construct complex "mist generators" that spritz dwarves with nice refreshing mist as they walk by

or, as I have personally witnessed in many players' fortresses, a lava pit for disposing of overly demanding royalty. It's Dwarven tradition.

There are countless examples of emergent gameplay in this game. I think the favorite example I heard was from a player who was trying to level up his blacksmith dwarf so he'd produce better gear. He was making the blacksmith produce endless amounts of knives made of cheap glass, and then he'd have the dwarf dump these garbage swords into a minecart atop a slope. Every so often, goblins would invade the fortress, so he would raise the drawbridges into the fortress and trick the goblins into taking a new path, near the blacksmith's workshop. When the goblins approached, he'd make the dwarf kick the minecart down the track, where it would rapidly gain speed and then turn a sharp corner, spilling all of its sharp glass knives at high velocity, right into the goblins. It wasn't particularly good for defense, but nonetheless, he found it incredibly amusing. Which I suppose takes me to my final point: the why. 

Why am I talking about emergent gameplay? Because some of the best and most memorable experiences naturally emerge from these complex interactions, and developers should always keep emergent gameplay in mind when designing their games. Emergent gameplay can also be a bad thing, emerging from a conflict between game mechanics. For example, some games punish players too harshly for getting hit, which incentivizes overly safe and boring playstyles, like finding a single powerful strategy for combat encounters and never trying anything else, instead of mixing things up in a fun way. However, I didn't want to focus on those, because I'd rather talk about the successes of developers, not the failures.

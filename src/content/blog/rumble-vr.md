## What is Rumble?
*Before I dive into my brief explanation, please watch a minute or so from this video. It's a tournament between two high-level players, and I think it's a good demonstration of what the game is capable of.*

In Rumble, you are a fighter with earthbending powers, dueling fellow earthbenders 1 on 1 in the arena. Much like an earthbender in Avatar, the Last Airbender, all of your abilities are activated with martials-arts style movements. You must use precise placement and rotation of your hands for everything you do (besides walking and voicechat control). There is no attack button, run button, or even jump button; all actions are performed with gestures.

There are 17 base moves in the game.

**4 ways to move:** Walk, run, dash, jump

**5 structures:** disc, pillar, wall, boulder, cube

**3 ways to hit structures:** straight (punch), uppercut, and kick

**5 ways to manipulate structures:** parry, flick, stomp, hold, and explode

I will not be showing all of the poses for obvious reasons, but here are 3 important ones to give you an idea of how it works.
![Structure Base Pose](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/rumble/images/0/0f/PoseBaseFront.png/revision/latest?cb=20230929211550)
This first pose is known as the "base pose". Elbows at your sides, with your arms out and your palms up. Fingers don't matter in this or any other pose, just position and rotation. This pose must be struck before summoning any structures.

![Pillar Pose](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/rumble/images/a/aa/PosePillarFront.png/revision/latest?cb=20230929211337)
This pose, when performed after the base pose, summons a pillar structure from the ground.

![Straight Pose Topview](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/rumble/images/1/18/PoseStraightAbove.png/revision/latest?cb=20230929211550)
![Straight Pose Sideview](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/rumble/images/7/75/PoseStraightSide.png/revision/latest?cb=20230929211555)
This is the "straight", which is basically a punch. When performed in front of a structure, like the pillar, it will launch that structure forwards. Smaller objects will accelerate faster

The rules for combat in this game are simple and elegant. You fight one on one in an arena with another earthbender, and your goal is to defeat them by hitting them with large rocks until they run out of health, or to knock them out of the arena circle. The various rocks you'll be flinging around are called "structures". Each structure has a base strength value, corresponding to its size:
-   Disc: 0
-   Boulder, Pillar: 1
-   Cube: 2
-   Wall: 3

When the structure is grounded, it gains 1 strength. If the structure is moving (grounded or not), it gains 1 strength. This strength value determines what the structure will do when it hits another structure. If both objects have the same value, they both explode on impact. If one has more strength than the other, it smashes through the other one and keeps its momentum. If a structure hits a player, they receive damage equal to the value, so heavier, grounded, and fast moving structures will hit harder.

This value system is fantastic because its simple, fairly intuitive, and more importantly, leads to some incredibly interesting combat. Players can throw small structures with high speed and range, but walls and pillars can be used to block those projectiles. To counter this, players may create their own walls and punch them into their opponent's walls, obliterating both structures and opening the opponent up to attacks. To counter this counter, the player may attack with their wall first, surprising the opponent, or they may create more walls, or reposition, and so on. This intense back and forth of both attack and defense, as you work up a sweat and frantically wave your arms, is what makes Rumble so fun. As you and your opponents get more skilled, the fights get more dynamic. 

Rewatch the video, in slow motion if necessary, and pay close attention to the hand movements of the players. It may be hard to tell, but they are performing many actions per second, expertly flowing from one position to the next, sometimes in as little as a quarter second. For example, both players use a rapid kick + uppercut + straight combo to launch structures at high speed in a nice arc. 

# Conclusion
Rumble is an absolute gem, and a shining example of using VR to its fullest. I hope game devs take inspiration from this when creating their own VR games in the future.
